# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Status | Security Updates |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 1.x     | Active | Yes |

Only the latest minor of the current major receives security fixes.

## Security Properties

This package is a **zero-dependency utility library**. Its security surface is small:

- No network requests — all functions are pure transforms or static data
- No DOM access — works entirely in JavaScript/Node.js without `window` or `document`
- Input sanitization via `sanitizeInput()`, `sanitizeHexColor()`, `sanitizeFileName()`
- Prototype-pollution-safe JSON parsing via `safeJSONParse()` (reviver drops `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys)
- FEN strings are length-capped at 93 characters before any parsing (`MAX_FEN_LENGTH`)
- SVG output escapes all attribute values to prevent XSS when embedded in HTML
